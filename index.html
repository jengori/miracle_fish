            <h2>Background</h2>

            <p>My first encounter with a Fortune Teller Miracle Fish was as a young girl one Christmas Day at my grandparents' house. 
                I still remember the feeling of wonder on discovering, inside a Christmas cracker, the magical red fish who promised to see inside my soul.  </p>
            
            <h2>How it works</h2>
            
            <p>Simply place the Fortune Teller Fish onto the palm of your hand, and its movements will tell you everything you need to know.</p>
